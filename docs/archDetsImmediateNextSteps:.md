Immediate Next Steps:
Deploy the Cloud Function: We'll deploy the Python function from your cloud_function/ directory to GCP. This function will automatically subscribe to the incoming-messages Pub/Sub topic and wait for events.
Test by Restarting the Local Watcher: After the cloud function is live, we'll restart your local email_langgraph_integration.js script. It will poll your email, publish a message to the topic, and the deployed cloud function will handle the rest.
The Final Step (After Testing):
You are correct again! After we confirm this setup works, the final step to make your system fully cloud-native and real-time would be to replace the local email watcher.
Currently, the watcher is still polling from your local machine. The ideal cloud architecture would be:
Use the Gmail API's Push Notifications (Webhooks): Instead of polling, we can have Gmail send a real-time notification to a tiny, new Cloud Function whenever an email arrives.
Trigger Pub/Sub: That new webhook function's only job would be to publish the event to your incoming-messages topic.
This eliminates the need for any long-running local scripts and makes your entire system event-driven. But for now, let's focus on getting the core agent deployed.
