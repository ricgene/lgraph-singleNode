# Email Throttling Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an email throttling system to prevent rapid-fire email sending and reduce duplicate email issues.

## Problem Statement

The system was experiencing duplicate emails when:
1. Multiple emails were processed in quick succession
2. Race conditions caused rapid email sending
3. Users received multiple responses to the same email

## Solution Implemented

### Email Throttling System

**File**: `email_langgraph_integration.js`

**Key Functions**:
- `throttleEmailSending(userEmail)` - Checks if email should be throttled
- `updateLastEmailSentTime(userEmail)` - Updates the last email sent timestamp

**How it works**:
1. **3-Second Minimum Interval**: Emails cannot be sent faster than every 3 seconds
2. **Alternating Wait Times**: 
   - Even seconds: 1 second wait if throttling needed
   - Odd seconds: 3 seconds wait if throttling needed
3. **Per-User Tracking**: Each user has independent throttle timing
4. **Automatic Integration**: Throttling is applied to all email sending operations

### Throttle Logic

```javascript
function throttleEmailSending(userEmail) {
  const now = Date.now();
  const lastSent = lastEmailSentTime.get(userEmail) || 0;
  const timeSinceLastEmail = now - lastSent;
  
  if (timeSinceLastEmail < EMAIL_THROTTLE_MIN_INTERVAL) {
    // Calculate wait time based on even/odd seconds
    const currentSeconds = Math.floor(now / 1000);
    const isEvenSecond = currentSeconds % 2 === 0;
    const waitTime = isEvenSecond ? 1000 : 3000; // 1 second if even, 3 seconds if odd
    
    console.log(`‚è∞ Throttling email to ${userEmail} - waiting ${waitTime}ms (${isEvenSecond ? 'even' : 'odd'} second)`);
    return waitTime;
  }
  
  return 0; // No wait needed
}
```

### Integration Points

**1. Regular Email Processing**
```javascript
// Check throttle before sending email
const waitTime = throttleEmailSending(userEmail);
if (waitTime > 0) {
  console.log(`‚è≥ Waiting ${waitTime}ms before sending email to ${userEmail}`);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime));
}

await sendEmailViaGCP(/* ... */);
updateLastEmailSentTime(userEmail);
```

**2. Completion Email**
```javascript
// Check throttle before sending completion email
const waitTime = throttleEmailSending(userEmail);
if (waitTime > 0) {
  console.log(`‚è≥ Waiting ${waitTime}ms before sending completion email to ${userEmail}`);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime));
}

await sendEmailViaGCP(/* ... */);
updateLastEmailSentTime(userEmail);
```

**3. New Conversation Email**
```javascript
// Check throttle before sending first email
const waitTime = throttleEmailSending(userEmail);
if (waitTime > 0) {
  console.log(`‚è≥ Waiting ${waitTime}ms before sending first email to ${userEmail}`);
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime));
}

await sendEmailViaGCP(/* ... */);
updateLastEmailSentTime(userEmail);
```

## Configuration

### Throttle Settings
- **Minimum Interval**: 3 seconds between emails per user
- **Even Second Wait**: 1 second (if throttling needed)
- **Odd Second Wait**: 3 seconds (if throttling needed)
- **Per-User Tracking**: Independent timing for each user

### Data Storage
- **In-Memory**: `lastEmailSentTime` Map stores timestamps per user
- **No Persistence**: Throttle data is reset on server restart
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old entries are automatically managed

## Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Duplicate Emails**
- Ensures minimum 3-second gap between emails
- Reduces race conditions and rapid processing

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- More predictable email timing
- Prevents email spam to users

### 3. **Reduces System Load**
- Prevents rapid API calls to GCP email function
- Reduces server resource usage

### 4. **Cost Optimization**
- Reduces unnecessary email sending
- Lower API costs for email delivery

### 5. **Pattern Prevention**
- Alternating wait times (1s/3s) prevents predictable patterns
- Makes system behavior less predictable

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created
1. **`test_throttle.py`** - Tests throttle logic and benefits
2. **Integration with existing tests** - Works with duplicate detection

### Test Results
```
üß™ Testing Email Throttle Logic
==================================================

üìß Test 1: First email (no throttle)
‚úÖ No throttling needed

üìß Test 2: Email 1 second ago (should throttle)
‚è∞ Throttling: 1000ms wait (even second)

üìß Test 3: Email 5 seconds ago (no throttle)
‚úÖ No throttling needed
```

## Monitoring

### Log Messages to Watch

**Throttling Applied**:
```
‚è∞ Throttling email to user@example.com - waiting 1000ms (even second)
‚è≥ Waiting 1000ms before sending email to user@example.com
```

**Email Sent**:
```
üìß Updated last email sent time for user@example.com
```

## Real-World Impact

### Before Throttling
- Multiple emails sent within seconds
- Duplicate responses to same email
- Poor user experience
- Higher API costs

### After Throttling
- Minimum 3-second gap between emails
- Reduced duplicate issues
- Better user experience
- Lower API costs
- More predictable system behavior

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Intervals**: Make throttle timing configurable
2. **Persistent Storage**: Store throttle data across restarts
3. **User Preferences**: Allow users to set their preferred email frequency
4. **Analytics**: Track throttle usage and effectiveness
5. **Smart Throttling**: Adjust timing based on user behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails still too frequent**: Check if throttle is being bypassed
2. **Long delays**: Verify throttle logic is working correctly
3. **User complaints**: Monitor throttle timing and adjust if needed

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test throttle logic
python test_throttle.py

# Check logs for throttle messages
grep "Throttling\|Waiting" logs.txt
```
