# Duplicate Email Detection Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a content-based duplicate email detection system to prevent sending multiple responses to the same email content.

## Problem Statement

The system was experiencing duplicate email responses when:
1. The same email content was processed multiple times
2. Server restarts caused old emails to be re-processed
3. Race conditions led to multiple processing of the same email

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Content-Based Duplicate Detection

**File**: `email_langgraph_integration.js`

**Key Functions**:
- `isEmailContentDuplicate(userEmail, emailContent)` - Checks if email content was already processed
- `addEmailContentToBuffer(userEmail, emailContent)` - Adds processed email content to buffer
- `clearEmailBuffer()` - Clears the email buffer file
- `loadEmailContentBuffer()` / `saveEmailContentBuffer()` - File I/O operations

**How it works**:
1. Each email content is hashed using MD5 (case-insensitive, trimmed)
2. Hashes are stored per user in `email_content_buffer.json`
3. Before processing, the system checks if the content hash already exists
4. If duplicate detected, email is skipped

### 2. Buffer Clearing Strategy

**Two key moments when buffer is cleared**:

#### A. Server Startup (`main()` function)
```javascript
async function main() {
  console.log('Starting LangGraph Email Integration...');
  
  // Clear email buffer file on startup
  clearEmailBuffer();
  
  // ... rest of startup code
}
```

**Purpose**: Prevents old duplicates from affecting new sessions

#### B. Before Sending Agent Email
```javascript
// Clear email buffer before sending agent email (as requested)
clearEmailBuffer();

// Send the next question if conversation is not complete
if (!result.is_complete && result.question) {
  await sendEmailViaGCP(/* ... */);
}
```

**Purpose**: Ensures fresh state for each response cycle

### 3. File Structure

**Buffer File**: `email_content_buffer.json`
```json
{
  "user@example.com": [
    "hash1_of_email_content",
    "hash2_of_email_content"
  ],
  "another@example.com": [
    "hash3_of_email_content"
  ]
}
```

**Features**:
- Per-user tracking (different users can send similar content)
- Limited to last 10 emails per user (prevents file growth)
- MD5 hashing for efficient comparison

## Implementation Details

### Email Processing Flow

1. **Email Received** → IMAP fetches new email
2. **Content Extraction** → Clean email body (remove quotes, headers)
3. **Duplicate Check** → `isEmailContentDuplicate(userEmail, userResponse)`
4. **If Duplicate** → Skip processing, log message
5. **If New** → Process through LangGraph
6. **Buffer Clear** → `clearEmailBuffer()` before sending response
7. **Add to Buffer** → `addEmailContentToBuffer(userEmail, userResponse)`

### Content Cleaning

The system cleans email content before hashing:
- Removes quoted text (lines starting with `>`)
- Removes email headers and signatures
- Trims whitespace and empty lines
- Case-insensitive processing

### Error Handling

- Graceful file I/O error handling
- Fallback to empty buffer if file operations fail
- Logging of all duplicate detection events

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created

1. **`test_duplicate_detection.py`** - Tests the duplicate detection logic
2. **`demo_buffer_clearing.py`** - Demonstrates buffer clearing workflow

### Test Results

```
🧪 Testing Duplicate Email Detection System
==================================================

📧 Test 1: First email
✅ First email would be processed

📧 Test 2: Second email (different content)
✅ Second email would be processed

📧 Test 3: Third email (duplicate content)
✅ Third email would be skipped (duplicate detected)

📧 Test 4: Buffer clearing
✅ Buffer clearing works correctly
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Duplicate Responses**: Same email content won't trigger multiple responses
2. **Fresh Sessions**: Server restarts start with clean state
3. **User-Specific**: Different users can send similar content
4. **Efficient**: MD5 hashing for fast comparison
5. **Robust**: Handles file I/O errors gracefully

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Uses existing Gmail and GCP configuration

### Files Created
- `email_content_buffer.json` - Email content hash storage
- `test_duplicate_detection.py` - Test script
- `demo_buffer_clearing.py` - Demonstration script

## Monitoring

### Log Messages to Watch

**Duplicate Detected**:
```
🚫 Duplicate email content detected for user@example.com
🚫 Skipping duplicate email content from user@example.com
```

**Buffer Operations**:
```
🗑️ Cleared email content buffer file
📝 Added email content to buffer for user@example.com
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Time-based Expiration**: Automatically expire old hashes
2. **Database Storage**: Move from file to database for scalability
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Detect similar but not identical content
4. **Metrics**: Track duplicate detection rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Buffer file not clearing**: Check file permissions
2. **False positives**: Verify content cleaning logic
3. **Performance**: Monitor buffer file size

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test duplicate detection
python test_duplicate_detection.py

# Demonstrate buffer clearing
python demo_buffer_clearing.py

# Check buffer file
cat email_content_buffer.json
```
